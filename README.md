# Vector-Autoregression-of-the-NZ-Gender-Pay-Gap.

**Executive Summary**

Research Goal:
The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the proportion of male & female employment, unemployment rate and the gender pay gap in New Zealand over the period of 1989Q1 to 2023Q2. The goal is to understand if there is an association between the proportion of gender employment males, the unemployment rate and the gender pay gap, which measures the difference in average hourly income between men and women.

Methods:
To investigate this relationship, three quarterly datasets provided by StatsNZ Infoshare will be utilized. The first dataset contains information on the average hourly income, broken down by gender, allowing changes to be monitored in pay gaps over time. The second dataset provides data on total employment, also categorized by gender, which helps to understand shifts in the labor market. The third provides data on the total number of people unemployed, used for measuring the unemployment rate.
A statistical technique called Vector Autoregression (VAR) is used to analyze these time series data. VAR allows for assessment of relationships between variables and how they are interrelated over time. By examining the dynamic interactions between these variables, insights can be gained into whether shifts in male employment have any discernible impact on the gender pay gap in New Zealand.

Findings:
The analysis provides evidence of a significant association between the proportion of gender employed and the gender pay gap and specific time periods. However, it remains inconclusive whether the unemployment rate is associated. It's essential to recognize that the gender pay gap is influenced by a wide array of factors. Accounting for the proportion of gender employment in pay gap analyses is advisable, but achieving a comprehensive understanding and effective solutions will require a broader exploration of diverse variables and policies. Consequently, these findings underscore the multifaceted nature of the gender pay gap and emphasize the importance of inclusive research and concerted efforts to advance gender pay equity.
